# BayouCaneBoy's Planck Layout

So, I have been using OSX for a while now, but the Windows dayz have greatly affected me. Even using a plank, I find that I want to use certain keyboard motions because:
    1. I have started working on both OSX (work) and Windows (home).
    1. I like vi, but some of the editors out there get in the way of coding with autocomplete and other features.
    1. I'm old and my muscle memory is really hard to change.
    1. It's fun to make things more consistent.
    1. Normal typing on a plank is very efficient for me; it's coding that struggles
    1. I intend to finish some other keyboards and use them. Split layout like ergodox or atreus is on the way.


## Inspirations
